## Brayden Gregersen, Southwest Applied Technology Collage, Object Oriented Programming
### This repository is to store all material that is created in the Object oriented class.
#### My Name is brayden and I have attended this school for 4 months now and have discovered a new passion for software development. I started this program to widen my understanding of computer science, and have found enjoyment in the technical challenges that come to play. I have worked in industrial manufacturing/industrial maintenance for the last 6 years and have found that although the challenges are very different, I enjoy solving problems in both worlds.
##### Once I finish this program I would like to collide my manufacturing and software development world and build different forms of software for manufacturing facilities.
